## **Project Description**

This project focuses on:
- Identifying spatial hotspots and analyzing temporal trends of dengue cases.
- Exploring demographic patterns based on gender and age.
- Developing predictive models for forecasting outbreak intensities.

### **Key Features:**
- Spatial clustering using SVM and K-Means.
- Temporal analysis using STL decomposition.
- Predictive modeling with Random Forest and Support Vector Regression.

### `Clustered_Heatmaps.zip`
This folder contains supplementary HTML files created for the project i.e., Clustered Heatmaps for Males and Females for the months of May, June, July, and Aug and Hotspots generated using SVM.
